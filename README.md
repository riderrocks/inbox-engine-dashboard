### Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/riderrocks/inbox-engine-dashboard.git
cd inbox-engine-dashboard
```

### Install Dependencies

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].


```
npm install && bower install
```

You should find that you have two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `bower_components` - contains the angular framework files
